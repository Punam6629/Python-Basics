        "1.  What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "- Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability, allowing developers to write clear and concise code, making it easier to learn and use compared to many other programming languages.\n",
        "- Why is Python Popular?\n",
        "- a.Versatility: Python is used in a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis, machine learning, automation, and even game development.\n",
        "- b.Community Support: Python has a large and active community, meaning there are plenty of resources, tutorials, and forums available for support.\n",
        "- c.Readability and Maintainability: Python’s clean, easy-to-read code makes it easier to maintain and collaborate on large projects.\n",
        "-d.Integration with Other Technologies: Python works well with other languages and platforms. It can be integrated with Java, C, C++, and many other technologies.\n",
        "- e . Growing Demand in Data Science & AI: With the rise of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, Python has become the go-to language for these fields due to libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, SciPy, and more.\n",
        "-f . Open Source: Python is open-source, meaning it's free to use, modify, and distribute.\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and executes the code you write, line-by-line. Unlike a compiler, which translates the entire source code into machine code before execution, an interpreter directly executes instructions from the source code, translating it into machine code on the fly as the program runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "- Pre-defined keywords in Python (also known as reserved words) are words that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.). These keywords define the syntax and structure of Python programs.\n",
        "4.  Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "- No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python because they have special meanings in the language.\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "- Mutability in Python\n",
        "Mutability in Python refers to whether an object can be changed (modified) after it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Types of Objects Based on Mutability\n",
        "- a. Mutable Objects (Can be changed)\n",
        "- b. Immutable Objects (Cannot be changed)\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "- The key difference between lists and tuples comes down to how they are stored in memory and their intended use cases.\n",
        "- 1. Lists Are Mutable\n",
        "-  Why?\n",
        "- Lists store references to objects and allow modifications (like adding, removing, or changing elements).\n",
        "Their structure is dynamic, meaning they can grow or shrink as needed.\n",
        "Python allows modifying the elements of a list in-place, so the same object in memory gets updated.\n",
        "- 2. Tuples Are Immutable\n",
        "-  Why?\n",
        "- Tuples store fixed data and do not allow modification after creation.\n",
        "Their structure is static, making them more memory-efficient.\n",
        "Python prevents changes to tuples for safety and performance reasons.\n",
        "Unlike lists, tuples store direct references to their elements in a way that prevents changes.\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, == and is are both comparison operators, but they serve different purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- == (Equality Operator)\n",
        "- The == operator checks whether two variables have the same value.\n",
        "= It compares the contents of the objects, regardless of their memory locations.\n",
        "- is (Identity Operator)\n",
        "- The is operator checks whether two variables reference the same object in memory.\n",
        "- It compares the identity (memory address) of the objects.\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "- Logical Operators in Python\n",
        "Logical operators in Python are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values (True or False). They help in decision-making and conditional statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "- Type Casting in Python\n",
        "Type casting (also called type conversion) is the process of converting one data type into another in Python. There are two types of type casting:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Implicit Type Casting (Automatic)\n",
        "- Explicit Type Casting (Manual)\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "- Implicit type casting\n",
        "- The compiler or interpreter automatically changes one data type to another\n",
        "- This is often invisible to the user\n",
        "- This can happen when converting a smaller integer to a larger one\n",
        "- This can also happen when converting a derived class to a base class\n",
        "- Explicit type casting\n",
        "- The programmer manually converts one data type to another\n",
        "- This is visible in the source code\n",
        "- This is also known as type casting\n",
        "- This is required when information might be lost in the conversion\n",
        "- This is required when converting a larger primitive type to a smaller one\n",
        "- This is required when converting a base-class instance to a derived class\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "- Purpose of Conditional Statements in Python\n",
        "Conditional statements in Python are used to control the flow of execution by making decisions based on conditions. They allow a program to execute certain blocks of code only if specific conditions are met, enabling dynamic and logical behavior.\n",
        "12.How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "- How Does the elif Statement Work in Python?\n",
        "- The elif statement (short for \"else if\") is used when multiple conditions need to be checked one by one. It allows a program to test multiple conditions sequentially, executing the first True condition and skipping the rest.\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "- Difference Between for and while Loops in Python\n",
        "- Both for and while loops are used for repeating a block of code, but they are used in different scenarios.\n",
        "- 1. for Loop\n",
        "- Used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.\n",
        "- Iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).\n",
        "- Automatically stops when the sequence ends.\n",
        "- 2. while Loop\n",
        "- Used when the number of iterations is unknown.\n",
        "- Runs until a condition becomes False.\n",
        "- Can create infinite loops if the condition never becomes False.\n",
        "14.  Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "- Scenario Where a while Loop is More Suitable Than a for Loop\n",
        "- A while loop is more suitable when we don’t know beforehand how many times the loop should run and need to keep repeating until a condition is met.\n",
